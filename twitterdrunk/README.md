This script aims to determine the drunkenness level of a given London tube stop. It queries the
Twitter API for the last 100 tweets within 1 mile of that station (it may not necessarily get this many) and then looks at earliest and latest timestamps to determine a tweet rate.

The coordinates file, tubestops.csv, comes from http://www.doogal.co.uk/london_stations.php
